<strong>What's Evo?</strong>

Taken directly from their <a title="FAQ" href="http://evo2k.com/faq/">FAQ</a>,
<blockquote>Evo (short for Evolution) is the world's largest fighting game event. Going on for now over a decade, Evo is the must-attend event for fighting game fans and competitors all over the world. Over three days, Evo hosts a variety of fighting game tournaments, exhibitions, and a free-play area where gamers can compete, meet up, and generally have a good time.</blockquote>
Make sure to follow the live streams at <a title="Evo Championship Series" href="http://evo2k.com">Evo 2K</a> to see how James (wangbus / Leviathan are his handles) does throughout the tournament.  If you're a hardcore gamer, make sure to check out <a title="Nocturna Lounge" href="http://nocturnalounge.com/" target="_blank">Nocturna Lounge</a> on Friday to watch live streams of the event -&gt; <a title="RSVP" href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=183029898428243" target="_blank">RSVP here!</a>
