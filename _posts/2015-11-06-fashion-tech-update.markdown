The workshops will be Tuesday, Nov 10 - Thursday, Nov 12 from 10am-3pm. Volunteering earns you a free ticket! Volunteer experience can range from students to professionals. If you are available and interested in volunteering please email <a href="mailto: info@shoux.media">info@shoux.media</a> with the days you are intersted in volunteering for.
