 In this workshop, we will learn to create 3D CAD models in a tools like Solidworks, AutoCAD, and Fusion 360 which incorporate our expectations about how those models will function in the real world.  We will discuss how to use parameterized geometry to connect what we see on the screen to what we want to fabricate and use. In addition to using standard CAD tools, workshop participants will use an experimental CAD tool created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.

This workshop is recommended for anyone with previous 3D modeling and/or fabrication experience who want to get more out of there 3D modeling experience. We will specifically be working with Autodesk Fusion 360 and request that all participants have this installed prior to the workshop. Installation is available here: https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/free-trial and recommended tutorials can be found here: http://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/. Participants should bring a personal laptop (PC or Mac) to the workshop.

###Megan Hoffman###
Megan Hofmann is a visiting researcher from the Human Computer Interaction Institute at  Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Her research explores maker culture and the development of CAD tools that enable "expert-amateurs" to create 3D models to augment their world. Her previous work has explored the intersection of 3D Printing and Assistive Technology design, such as [customized prosthetic arms](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2017/05/15/this-3d-printed-arm-was-designed-to-help-a-boy-play-the-cello/#2e63a6142768). Her current work has two directions. First, she is developing tools that relate parameterized geometric design to a programmatic design structure, with the goal of creating verifiable and functional 3D models in less iterations. A tangential research project is in collaboration with Disney Research to create a tool for parameterized generative sweater and knitted garment design.
