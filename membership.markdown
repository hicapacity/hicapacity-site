There has been a lot of interest from HI Capacity members and the maker community to open a Makerspace. We have attained our dedicated space! We are located at the very back of The Box Jelly. Enter through the front of The Box Jelly and go all the way to the back (past the conference rooms and the canvas door). We are on the right inside of the white sliding doors!

**Hours of Operation**

Monday-Friday, 8am-12am
Saturday-Sunday, 11am-6pm

**Restrictions**

Certain evenings will be closed due to Box Jelly events. We will notify you in advance when the Makerspace will be closed.

**What is Provided**

* Space to work on software/hardware projects. Soldering is allowed.
* A limited amount of storage space to store your projects.
* Comfortable chairs and tables.
* Whiteboards.
* A community of people that want to do things!

**Monthly Dues**
