Membership
==========
<div class="postHeaderRule"></div>

There has been a lot of interest from HI Capacity members and the maker community to open a Makerspace. To keep the movement going, [The Box Jelly](http://theboxjelly.com/) has graciously allowed HI Capacity to create an interim Makerspace at it's location while we search for a more permanent home.

We will be open on Monday, October 10th.

**Hours of Operation**

Monday-Friday, 6pm-12am
Saturday-Sunday, 11am-6pm

**Restrictions**

Certain evenings will be closed due to Box Jelly events. We will notify you in advance when the Makerspace will be closed.

**What is Provided**

* Space to work on software/hardware projects. Soldering is allowed.
* A limited amount of storage space to store your projects.
* Comfortable chairs and tables.
* Whiteboards.
* A community of people that want to do things!

**Monthly Dues**

$35/month &mdash; Basic membership, which includes access to the space.

$50/month &mdash; This includes basic membership and a personal web page on the hicapacity.org subdomain. You can advertise your membership or talk about your projects! Your additional contribution will go towards opening a larger Makerspace and equipment. By contributing a little more, you can help our Makerspace grow even faster!

Parking is available at Sports Authority (owned by the same land owner). There is also street parking around the neighborhood.

**Our Future**

The monthly **membership cost will increase** when we move to a new space, but with the increased price, we will continuously improve our Makerspace. We want to open our own Makerspace soon. When that happens we'll be able to add more to your membership.

* 24-hour access for upper tier members
* More storage space

And we'll continue to grow.

* Projector
* Monitors
* More desks
* Space for machinery
* 3D printers
* CNC Machines
* Laser cutters
* Lathes and other tools
* Fridge
* Espresso Machine
* Any maker tool you can imagine!
