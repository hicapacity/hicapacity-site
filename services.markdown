#### 3D Printing ####
We currently have a MakerBot Replicator (Fifth Generation) available for printing models. Designated HICapacity members will assist anyone wishing to use the printer. Please note that this printer only accepts PLA, so if you would like to bring your own material make sure it is PLA.

##### Printing Rates #####
* $5 flat fee (waived for HICapacity &amp; BoxJelly members)
* $0.05/min of printing time

There is a flat fee for using the printer. In addition to the flat fee, it costs $0.05 per a minute of printer usage. Larger or higher quality models will take longer. Final cost cannot be determined until model is completed. Please note that the MakerBot Replicator will attempt to estimate the amount of time the model will take to print but this is frequently wrong.
